# MIDI NAME DOCUMENTS

This repository was created to hold a MIDNAM file for Roland XPS-30 . 

You can use it with Ardour (tested with Ardour 5.5.12). Put the file on `~/.config/ardour5/patchfiles` . If Ardour is open, quit then start it again.

Ardour will be able to receive Program Control Change from the Keyboard/Synthesizer or to set the patches on the Keyboard/Synthesizer based on the *Patch Selector* window.

This settings will be stored within the Session and the Keyboard/Synthesizer will be reconfigured every time the Session is reopened.
